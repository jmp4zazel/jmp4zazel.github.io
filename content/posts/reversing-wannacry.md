# why reverse wannacry, when there's already so many posts out there?
I've been learning x86-64 assembly lately, and I wanted to apply my learning already. so yeah, that's all.

## entrypoint
before finding the entrypoint of the malware, we can tell that this malware is written in C/C++ by looking at the symbols where it's using functions like memcpy, strncpy, etc.

now looking at **_start**, looking at line **57** we can see here that it's calling to a function, so this is most likely the entrypoint I already renamed it to **main()**
```c
  53 @ 00409b3a  uint32_t wShowWindow_1 = wShowWindow
  54 @ 00409b3b  char* var_90 = esi
  55 @ 00409b3c  int32_t var_94_1 = 0
  56 @ 00409b44  HMODULE var_98_1 = GetModuleHandleA(lpModuleName: nullptr)
  57 @ 00409b45  main()
```

Now, let's look at our **main()** function. I already renamed these variables, so you can understand it but I'm still going to explain these.
```c
int32_t main()

    void variableContainingURL
    char* AnotherVariableContainingURL
    char* VariableContainingURL

    VariableContainingURL,
    AnotherVariableContainingURL =
        __builtin_memcpy(
            dest: &variableContainingURL,
            src: "http://www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com",
            count: 56
        )

    *VariableContainingURL = *AnotherVariableContainingURL

    int32_t var_17
    __builtin_memset(dest: &var_17, ch: 0, count: 23)

    int32_t hInternet =
        InternetOpenA(
            lpszAgent: nullptr,
            dwAccessType: 1,
            lpszProxy: nullptr,
            lpszProxyBypass: nullptr,
            dwFlags: 0
        )

    int32_t hInternet_1 =
        InternetOpenUrlA(
            hInternet,
            lpszUrl: &variableContainingURL,
            lpszHeaders: nullptr,
            dwHeadersLength: 0,
            dwFlags: 0x84000000,
            dwContext: 0
        )

    if (hInternet_1 != 0)
        InternetCloseHandle(hInternet)
        InternetCloseHandle(hInternet_1)
        return 0

    InternetCloseHandle(hInternet)
    InternetCloseHandle(0)

    stage2()

    return 0
```
