      <h2>SYBAU: You Are Not Tracking Anyone With an IP Address</h2>
    

    <h1 id="kinda-random-article-why">Kinda random article, why?</h1>
<p>I keep hearing a ton of misinformation about how you can supposedly use an IP address to track a person. I’ve also been a bit rusty on networking fundamentals, so this is a good excuse to refresh them.</p>
<p>Learning by teaching.</p>
<h1 id="what-in-the-world-is-an-ip-address">What in the world is an IP address?</h1>
<p>An IP address is a <strong>logical addressing system</strong> used to identify a network interface so data can be routed across networks.</p>
<p>“Logical” means it is software-defined. It is not tied to a physical location, a device owner, or an identity. IP addresses can be assigned dynamically or statically, reassigned, rotated, or shared between many users.</p>
<p>An IP address exists so packets know <strong>where to go</strong>, not <strong>who you are</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="wait-what-does-logical-addressing-even-mean">Wait, what does “logical addressing” even mean?</h2>
<p>It means the identifier exists purely at the network layer. Unlike MAC addresses or physical wiring, IP addresses are abstract and flexible.</p>
<p>Your IP can change:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you reconnect to a network</li>
<li>When your ISP rotates addresses</li>
<li>When you move between networks</li>
<li>When traffic is routed through NAT or CGNAT</li>
</ul>
<p>There is nothing inherently personal about it.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-an-ip-address-useful-in-a-real-world-scenario">How is an IP address useful in a real-world scenario?</h2>
<p>Let’s say you visit <code>youtube.com</code> in your browser.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your computer sends a request to a DNS server asking for the IP address associated with <code>youtube.com</code>.</li>
<li>The DNS server responds with one or more IP addresses.</li>
<li>Your computer sends an HTTP request to that IP address.</li>
<li>Routers across the internet forward your packets hop-by-hop based on the destination IP address. This process is called <strong>routing</strong>.</li>
<li>The YouTube server processes the request and sends the response back to your <strong>public IP address</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Without IP addresses, the internet literally could not function. There would be no way for responses to find their way back to the requester.</p>
<h2 id="now-you-see">Now you see</h2>
<p>IP addresses are not about identity or tracking. They are about <strong>delivery</strong>.</p>
<p>They exist so packets can reach the correct endpoint and return a response.</p>
<h1 id="but-can-you-still-track-location-from-an-ip-address">But can you still track location from an IP address?</h1>
<p>Yes — but not in the way people usually imagine.</p>
<p>An IP address does <strong>not</strong> give you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone’s home address</li>
<li>Their exact location</li>
<li>Their identity</li>
</ul>
<p>At best, it provides a <strong>general location estimate</strong>, and even that is often wrong.</p>
<h1 id="so-how-does-ip-based-location-actually-work">So how does IP-based location actually work?</h1>
<p>IP lookup tools query databases that map IP address blocks to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Service Providers</li>
<li>Registered regions or cities</li>
<li>Network infrastructure locations</li>
</ul>
<p>This mapping is based on <strong>where the ISP’s network operates</strong>, not where the user physically is.</p>
<p>In practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile users often appear in the same city nationwide</li>
<li>CGNAT users share a single public IP</li>
<li>VPN users appear wherever the exit node is</li>
<li>Two users in different provinces can resolve to the same city</li>
</ul>
<p>You are seeing the location of the <strong>network endpoint</strong>, not the person.</p>
<h1 id="can-someone-hack-you-just-by-knowing-your-ip-address">Can someone hack you just by knowing your IP address?</h1>
<p>An IP address alone is not an exploit.</p>
<p>You are only at risk if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your IP is publicly reachable</li>
<li>You are exposing a service</li>
<li>That service has a vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, hosting an unpatched Windows 7 server directly on the internet is a bad idea. But the average user is not doing this.</p>
<p>Most people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are behind NAT or carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT)</li>
<li>Do not expose services to the internet</li>
<li>Are protected by basic firewalling</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing your IP address does not magically grant access.</p>
<h1 id="what-about-people-threatening-to-ddos-my-ip-address">What about people threatening to DDoS my IP address?</h1>
<p>These threats are almost always meaningless.</p>
<p>If you are behind CGNAT:</p>
<ul>
<li>You share a public IP with many users</li>
<li>Your ISP controls traffic filtering</li>
<li>Your ISP absorbs or drops malicious traffic upstream</li>
</ul>
<p>Even without CGNAT, ISPs already implement rate limiting, filtering, and mitigation. Random people “threatening” DDoS attacks are usually just repeating words they don’t understand.</p>
<h1 id="but-what-about-the-feds">But what about the feds?</h1>
<p>This is where things are different.</p>
<p>Law enforcement cannot magically “track you” just by looking at an IP address. What they <em>can</em> do is use legal authority to <strong>request records from your ISP</strong>.</p>
<p>ISPs log:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which customer was assigned which public IP</li>
<li>At what time</li>
<li>From which access network</li>
</ul>
<p>If law enforcement has a valid legal request, the ISP can correlate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>public IP + timestamp → subscriber account</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the IP address itself still isn’t the tracker.<br>
The <strong>ISP’s logs</strong> are.</p>
<p>If this is happening to you, it usually means:</p>
<ul>
<li>You did something serious enough to justify legal process</li>
<li>You were already on someone’s radar</li>
<li>The IP was just one piece of evidence, not the starting point</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also why people use VPNs. That topic deserves its own article, because VPNs do not make you anonymous, they just shift <strong>who can see your traffic and who holds the logs</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="ive-seen-regular-people-track-others-using-an-ip-address-though">I&rsquo;ve seen regular people &ldquo;track&rdquo; others using an IP address though</h1>
<p>What they’re actually doing is <strong>correlating digital footprints</strong>, not tracking an IP.</p>
<p>An IP address might provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>A country or city</li>
<li>An ISP name</li>
<li>A rough region</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, OSINT techniques fill in the gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Username reuse</li>
<li>Social media posts</li>
<li>Leaked data</li>
<li>Writing style</li>
<li>Time zones</li>
<li>Photos, metadata, habits</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>An IP resolves to a city</li>
<li>The ISP’s main office is also in that city</li>
<li>The target posts photos or info that align with that location</li>
</ul>
<p>None of that comes from the IP address itself.<br>
The IP is just <strong>one weak signal among many</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="final-clarification">Final clarification</h1>
<p>When people say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I tracked them using their IP”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What they usually mean is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I correlated multiple data points and the IP was the least useful one.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IP addresses are low-signal, high-noise data.<br>
You get track because of you voluntarily expose, not from a routing identifier.</p>
<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>
<p>An IP address is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not an identity</li>
<li>Not a tracking mechanism</li>
<li>Not a hacking shortcut</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a routing label used by the internet to move packets from point A to point B.</p>
<p>If someone claims they can “track you” with just an IP address, what they actually mean is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t understand networking, but I want to sound intimidating.”</p>
</blockquote>
